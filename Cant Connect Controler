I'm posting here because there is no option to post in the issues tab for some dumb fucking reson... 
But now that I'm done with that rage outburst from the stress and irritation of trying to get this to work... on to the issue.
When I connect a new controller and install the drivers it works, but as soon as I dissconnect or close the driver installer or
turn off my computer or just unplug the controller from my computer it will never let me connect that controller ever again...
Idk why, idk how to fix it. and I would post the log package but this isnt a comment platform... its a program thing or whatever. 
so if somehow someone can comment on this and tell me how to get to the comments and post an issue or just tell me how to fix it
that would be great.
